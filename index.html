<h3>Epic battle story about saving the Earth!</h1>
You were sent out to space to save the day! A nasty mysterious triangle-shaped UFO came to take out our planet... It looks to be invincible, but NASA found out it is actually vulnerable to nuclear radiation, that's why they implemented a radiation emitting device in your cool big red spaceship! 
<p>
The closer you are to the UFO - the more powerful the radiation cloud gets!
Just be careful - triangle tends to go imba every now and then - if I were you (a badass spaceship captain) I'd certainly look for a safe spot as soon as possible!</p>

<p>Use W,A,S,D or the arrows to control your spaceship!</p>
<p>
Good luck!</p>
